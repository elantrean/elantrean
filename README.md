- 👋 Hi, I’m @elantrean
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, algorithm and some front-end development. Though I have some interest on programming, my major is biology and will graduate from SUSTech's bioinformatics major. I'm looking forward to dive deep into the cutting-edge of biology and algorithm. And I believe one day the AI will collaborate with current messy bioinformatic data.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning MIT6.874 in youtube
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing user friendly tools and algorithms in bioinformatics 
- 📫 How to reach me my email is elantreanfu@qq.com and elantreanfu@gmail.com the former one is commonly used, and the current school mailbox is 11810503@mail.sustech.edu.cn
